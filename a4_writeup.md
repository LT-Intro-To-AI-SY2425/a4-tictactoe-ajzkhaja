# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
Knowing how to organize everything so you don't get messed up when writing the code. 

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
Make it so the play tic tac toe function randomly selects a move.    

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
Go to the corner everytime or select a number that goes to the corner because that's where you have to go first in order to win.
